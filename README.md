#🐱 Task completed: 
Image Classification of Cats and Dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🐶
#🎯 Objective:
To classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
#📂 Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's "Dogs vs. Cats" competition. It includes 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs for training and 12,500 images for testing.
#🛠️ Steps and Workflow:
1. Data Preparation:
📦 Unzipping the Dataset: Extracted the zip files for processing.
🔍 Reading and Exploring the Data: Verified image counts in training and testing directories.
📁 Organizing the Data: Sorted images into lists for cats and dogs based on filenames.
2. Data Preprocessing:
🗂️ Creating a DataFrame: Stored image paths and labels in a pandas DataFrame.
📸 Visualizing the Data: Displayed samples of cat and dog images.
🔀 Train-Test Split: Split data into training, validation, and testing sets using stratified sampling.
3. Image Preprocessing:
📏 Image Resizing: Resized images to 100x100 pixels.
➡️ Flattening the Images: Converted images into 1D arrays for SVM input.
4. Dimensionality Reduction:
📉 PCA: Applied PCA to reduce data dimensionality, retaining key features.
5. Model Training:
🖥️ SVM: Trained an SVM with an RBF kernel on the reduced data.
6. Model Evaluation:
📊 Accuracy: Achieved 67.64% accuracy on the test set.
7. Submission:
🧪 Test Predictions: Made predictions on the test dataset with the trained SVM.
📝 Submission File: Saved predictions in a CSV file for submission.

🧠 Knowledge Gained:
Data Preprocessing and Exploration: Learned how to handle large image datasets, preprocess images, and explore data distributions.

Machine Learning with SVM: Gained practical experience in training and tuning an SVM model for image classification tasks.

Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Understood the importance and application of PCA in reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data.

Model Evaluation and Submission: Learned to evaluate model performance and prepare prediction files for competition submission.

This project provided a comprehensive experience in handling image data and applying machine learning techniques to solve a binary classification problem. The process from data preparation to model evaluation and submission covered crucial steps in a typical machine learning workflow.
